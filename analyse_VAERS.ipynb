       "15  I am a immunization nurse at this location.  I gave 2 of the first 4 Covid vaccinations given at our location.  Then I received dose # 5.  It was easy.  I did a couple of things and then returned to my desk.  As I sat down, my arm started feeling very heavy.  I was unable to send a text.  I told staff that I was feeling funny and that I was going to the other room to lay down.  Staff followed me and took my Pulse 100 and BP 164/ 82 (high for me!)  .  I felt shaky, but my hands were not shaking.  Put a wet cloth on my head and laid there a few minutes, telling staff stories and laughing at my BP.  When I sat up, my BP was 126/74 and pulse was 80.  I stood up for a minute or two, then my legs got heavy and I sat down for a few more minutes.  I went to the bathroom and came back to my desk, but was weak and tired.  I ate and drank some fluids.  Because it was snowing  and I live 25 miles away, I accepted a ride home from a co-worker.  I walked across the parking lot without problems and talked all the way home.  At home, I was tired, but had a sandwich and talked on the phone.  I would still describe myself as tired, but functioning.   \n",

The agent helped walk me to a chair and I felt really loopy in the head.  After the 15 minutes, I got up and immediately felt the whole room was spinning causing me to have to sit back down another 15 minutes.  Closing my eyes made the dizziness much worse.  I was given juice, my sugar was checked at was 115.  After about 30 minutes I stood and felt alot better.  I went back to my assigned duties but was feeling super bad and my supervisor sent me home because they states I didnt look good.  On the drive home I threw up and my PCP called in Zopran to help with the nausea.   \n",

Decided to sleep the remainder of the day but no fever just was fatigued and had a headache.  My arm was hurting at the injection site but the pain has sense left and the headache is gone also.   \n",

I did a couple of things and then returned to my desk.  As I sat down, my arm started feeling very heavy.  I was unable to send a text.  I told staff that I was feeling funny and that I was going to the other room to lay down.  Staff followed me and took my Pulse 100 and BP 164/ 82 (high for me!)  .  I felt shaky, but my hands were not shaking.  Put a wet cloth on my head and laid there a few minutes, telling staff stories and laughing at my BP.  When I sat up, my BP was 126/74 and pulse was 80.  I stood up for a minute or two, then my legs got heavy and I sat down for a few more minutes.  I went to the bathroom and came back to my desk, but was weak and tired.  I ate and drank some fluids.  Because it was snowing  and I live 25 miles away, I accepted a ride home from a co-worker.  I walked across the parking lot without problems and talked all the way home.  At home, I was tired, but had a sandwich and talked on the phone.  I would still describe myself as tired, but functioning.</td>\n",

       "15  I am a immunization nurse at this location.  I gave 2 of the first 4 Covid vaccinations given at our location.  Then I received dose # 5.  It was easy.  I did a couple of things and then returned to my desk.  As I sat down, my arm started feeling very heavy.  I was unable to send a text.  I told staff that I was feeling funny and that I was going to the other room to lay down.  Staff followed me and took my Pulse 100 and BP 164/ 82 (high for me!)  .  I felt shaky, but my hands were not shaking.  Put a wet cloth on my head and laid there a few minutes, telling staff stories and laughing at my BP.  When I sat up, my BP was 126/74 and pulse was 80.  I stood up for a minute or two, then my legs got heavy and I sat down for a few more minutes.  I went to the bathroom and came back to my desk, but was weak and tired.  I ate and drank some fluids.  Because it was snowing  and I live 25 miles away, I accepted a ride home from a co-worker.  I walked across the parking lot without problems and talked all the way home.  At home, I was tired, but had a sandwich and talked on the phone.  I would still describe myself as tired, but functioning.  \n",

The agent helped walk me to a chair and I felt really loopy in the head.  After the 15 minutes, I got up and immediately felt the whole room was spinning causing me to have to sit back down another 15 minutes.  Closing my eyes made the dizziness much worse.  I was given juice, my sugar was checked at was 115.  After about 30 minutes I stood and felt alot better.  I went back to my assigned duties but was feeling super bad and my supervisor sent me home because they states I didnt look good.  On the drive home I threw up and my PCP called in Zopran to help with the nausea.  \n",

       "15  I am a immunization nurse at this location.  I gave 2 of the first 4 Covid vaccinations given at our location.  Then I received dose # 5.  It was easy.  I did a couple of things and then returned to my desk.  As I sat down, my arm started feeling very heavy.  I was unable to send a text.  I told staff that I was feeling funny and that I was going to the other room to lay down.  Staff followed me and took my Pulse 100 and BP 164/ 82 (high for me!)  .  I felt shaky, but my hands were not shaking.  Put a wet cloth on my head and laid there a few minutes, telling staff stories and laughing at my BP.  When I sat up, my BP was 126/74 and pulse was 80.  I stood up for a minute or two, then my legs got heavy and I sat down for a few more minutes.  I went to the bathroom and came back to my desk, but was weak and tired.  I ate and drank some fluids.  Because it was snowing  and I live 25 miles away, I accepted a ride home from a co-worker.  I walked across the parking lot without problems and talked all the way home.  At home, I was tired, but had a sandwich and talked on the phone.  I would still describe myself as tired, but functioning.  \n",

The agent helped walk me to a chair and I felt really loopy in the head.  After the 15 minutes, I got up and immediately felt the whole room was spinning causing me to have to sit back down another 15 minutes.  Closing my eyes made the dizziness much worse.  I was given juice, my sugar was checked at was 115.  After about 30 minutes I stood and felt alot better.  I went back to my assigned duties but was feeling super bad and my supervisor sent me home because they states I didnt look good.  On the drive home I threw up and my PCP called in Zopran to help with the nausea.  \n",

       "15  I am a immunization nurse at this location.  I gave 2 of the first 4 Covid vaccinations given at our location.  Then I received dose # 5.  It was easy.  I did a couple of things and then returned to my desk.  As I sat down, my arm started feeling very heavy.  I was unable to send a text.  I told staff that I was feeling funny and that I was going to the other room to lay down.  Staff followed me and took my Pulse 100 and BP 164/ 82 (high for me!)  .  I felt shaky, but my hands were not shaking.  Put a wet cloth on my head and laid there a few minutes, telling staff stories and laughing at my BP.  When I sat up, my BP was 126/74 and pulse was 80.  I stood up for a minute or two, then my legs got heavy and I sat down for a few more minutes.  I went to the bathroom and came back to my desk, but was weak and tired.  I ate and drank some fluids.  Because it was snowing  and I live 25 miles away, I accepted a ride home from a co-worker.  I walked across the parking lot without problems and talked all the way home.  At home, I was tired, but had a sandwich and talked on the phone.  I would still describe myself as tired, but functioning.  \n",

The agent helped walk me to a chair and I felt really loopy in the head.  After the 15 minutes, I got up and immediately felt the whole room was spinning causing me to have to sit back down another 15 minutes.  Closing my eyes made the dizziness much worse.  I was given juice, my sugar was checked at was 115.  After about 30 minutes I stood and felt alot better.  I went back to my assigned duties but was feeling super bad and my supervisor sent me home because they states I didnt look good.  On the drive home I threw up and my PCP called in Zopran to help with the nausea.  \n",
