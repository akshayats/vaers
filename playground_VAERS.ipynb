       "15  I am a immunization nurse at this location.  I gave 2 of the first 4 Covid vaccinations given at our location.  Then I received dose # 5.  It was easy.  I did a couple of things and then returned to my desk.  As I sat down, my arm started feeling very heavy.  I was unable to send a text.  I told staff that I was feeling funny and that I was going to the other room to lay down.  Staff followed me and took my Pulse 100 and BP 164/ 82 (high for me!)  .  I felt shaky, but my hands were not shaking.  Put a wet cloth on my head and laid there a few minutes, telling staff stories and laughing at my BP.  When I sat up, my BP was 126/74 and pulse was 80.  I stood up for a minute or two, then my legs got heavy and I sat down for a few more minutes.  I went to the bathroom and came back to my desk, but was weak and tired.  I ate and drank some fluids.  Because it was snowing  and I live 25 miles away, I accepted a ride home from a co-worker.  I walked across the parking lot without problems and talked all the way home.  At home, I was tired, but had a sandwich and talked on the phone.  I would still describe myself as tired, but functioning.   \n",

She was sitting, and felt short of breath without wheeze or tightness in the chest or throat.  She stood up, and then felt tunneling.  Assisted to chair and floor.  Pulse weak, skin flushed, sweating on torso.  Face and Neck remained flushed and red. She refused epi at first.  So we gave her benedryll 25 mg po with apple juice.  She said she just had a big meal 30 min prior, but we checked her blood sugar- it was 85.  10 min after the first SOB feeling, it returned.  BP was recorded as 160/100.   \n",

The agent helped walk me to a chair and I felt really loopy in the head.  After the 15 minutes, I got up and immediately felt the whole room was spinning causing me to have to sit back down another 15 minutes.  Closing my eyes made the dizziness much worse.  I was given juice, my sugar was checked at was 115.  After about 30 minutes I stood and felt alot better.

I did a couple of things and then returned to my desk.  As I sat down, my arm started feeling very heavy.  I was unable to send a text.  I told staff that I was feeling funny and that I was going to the other room to lay down.  Staff followed me and took my Pulse 100 and BP 164/ 82 (high for me!)  .  I felt shaky, but my hands were not shaking.  Put a wet cloth on my head and laid there a few minutes, telling staff stories and laughing at my BP.  When I sat up, my BP was 126/74 and pulse was 80.  I stood up for a minute or two, then my legs got heavy and I sat down for a few more minutes.  I went to the bathroom and came back to my desk, but was weak and tired.  I ate and drank some fluids.  Because it was snowing  and I live 25 miles away, I accepted a ride home from a co-worker.  I walked across the parking lot without problems and talked all the way home.  At home, I was tired, but had a sandwich and talked on the phone.  I would still describe myself as tired, but functioning.</td>\n",

       "15  I am a immunization nurse at this location.  I gave 2 of the first 4 Covid vaccinations given at our location.  Then I received dose # 5.  It was easy.  I did a couple of things and then returned to my desk.  As I sat down, my arm started feeling very heavy.  I was unable to send a text.  I told staff that I was feeling funny and that I was going to the other room to lay down.  Staff followed me and took my Pulse 100 and BP 164/ 82 (high for me!)  .  I felt shaky, but my hands were not shaking.  Put a wet cloth on my head and laid there a few minutes, telling staff stories and laughing at my BP.  When I sat up, my BP was 126/74 and pulse was 80.  I stood up for a minute or two, then my legs got heavy and I sat down for a few more minutes.  I went to the bathroom and came back to my desk, but was weak and tired.  I ate and drank some fluids.  Because it was snowing  and I live 25 miles away, I accepted a ride home from a co-worker.  I walked across the parking lot without problems and talked all the way home.  At home, I was tired, but had a sandwich and talked on the phone.  I would still describe myself as tired, but functioning.  \n",

The agent helped walk me to a chair and I felt really loopy in the head.  After the 15 minutes, I got up and immediately felt the whole room was spinning causing me to have to sit back down another 15 minutes.  Closing my eyes made the dizziness much worse.  I was given juice, my sugar was checked at was 115.  After about 30 minutes I stood and felt alot better.  I went back to my assigned duties but was feeling super bad and my supervisor sent me home because they states I didnt look good.  On the drive home I threw up and my PCP called in Zopran to help with the nausea.  \n",

       "15  I am a immunization nurse at this location.  I gave 2 of the first 4 Covid vaccinations given at our location.  Then I received dose # 5.  It was easy.  I did a couple of things and then returned to my desk.  As I sat down, my arm started feeling very heavy.  I was unable to send a text.  I told staff that I was feeling funny and that I was going to the other room to lay down.  Staff followed me and took my Pulse 100 and BP 164/ 82 (high for me!)  .  I felt shaky, but my hands were not shaking.  Put a wet cloth on my head and laid there a few minutes, telling staff stories and laughing at my BP.  When I sat up, my BP was 126/74 and pulse was 80.  I stood up for a minute or two, then my legs got heavy and I sat down for a few more minutes.  I went to the bathroom and came back to my desk, but was weak and tired.  I ate and drank some fluids.  Because it was snowing  and I live 25 miles away, I accepted a ride home from a co-worker.  I walked across the parking lot without problems and talked all the way home.  At home, I was tired, but had a sandwich and talked on the phone.  I would still describe myself as tired, but functioning.  \n",

The agent helped walk me to a chair and I felt really loopy in the head.  After the 15 minutes, I got up and immediately felt the whole room was spinning causing me to have to sit back down another 15 minutes.  Closing my eyes made the dizziness much worse.  I was given juice, my sugar was checked at was 115.  After about 30 minutes I stood and felt alot better.  I went back to my assigned duties but was feeling super bad and my supervisor sent me home because they states I didnt look good.  On the drive home I threw up and my PCP called in Zopran to help with the nausea.  \n",

       "15  I am a immunization nurse at this location.  I gave 2 of the first 4 Covid vaccinations given at our location.  Then I received dose # 5.  It was easy.  I did a couple of things and then returned to my desk.  As I sat down, my arm started feeling very heavy.  I was unable to send a text.  I told staff that I was feeling funny and that I was going to the other room to lay down.  Staff followed me and took my Pulse 100 and BP 164/ 82 (high for me!)  .  I felt shaky, but my hands were not shaking.  Put a wet cloth on my head and laid there a few minutes, telling staff stories and laughing at my BP.  When I sat up, my BP was 126/74 and pulse was 80.  I stood up for a minute or two, then my legs got heavy and I sat down for a few more minutes.  I went to the bathroom and came back to my desk, but was weak and tired.  I ate and drank some fluids.  Because it was snowing  and I live 25 miles away, I accepted a ride home from a co-worker.  I walked across the parking lot without problems and talked all the way home.  At home, I was tired, but had a sandwich and talked on the phone.  I would still describe myself as tired, but functioning.  \n",

The agent helped walk me to a chair and I felt really loopy in the head.  After the 15 minutes, I got up and immediately felt the whole room was spinning causing me to have to sit back down another 15 minutes.  Closing my eyes made the dizziness much worse.  I was given juice, my sugar was checked at was 115.  After about 30 minutes I stood and felt alot better.  I went back to my assigned duties but was feeling super bad and my supervisor sent me home because they states I didnt look good.  On the drive home I threw up and my PCP called in Zopran to help with the nausea.  \n",

He received a DTaP shot at about 11:30am, we got home maybe 20-30 minutes later where I stood him in our living room and got settled. At about 12:00pm he started crying inconsolably, but wouldn?t move.  I said, ?come here,? but he just stood there, cries turning to screams. I grab his hand to get him to walk closer, but he falls over and does not get up.  I pick him up, trying to calm him, but he?s still crying uncontrollably.  I try to stand him in my lap, but he feels limp. I check everything on him, making sure he?s okay, seeing what I can do to help, nothing helps.  I have no clue what?s going on or how to help, so I call the doctors office - I can only hear some of what they are saying, but I try to tell the nurse what?s going on while he cries in the background, the nurse told me that soreness is to be expected and to give some Tylenol.  We?ve had shots before, but never any of this. Never crying like this, never going limp like this.  I finally calm him down and get him to sleep long enough for my husband to come home.  After weeks/months of research, talking to a family friend who had knowledge in this area, and a few nurse friends, I was able to discover that this was a hypotonic hypersensitive episode.   That afternoon and the following few days of that week, it?s as if Patient was re-learning how to walk. He was 15 months and had started walking at 11 months, so this was not a difficult task for him, but he was very clumsy, would stumble and fall several times a day. My husband and I both made comments to each other about him being very clumsy.  Patient also had/has a speech regression/delay which I am confident came after this. I only say this because I spent every day with him before and after and watched the regression and these are the things that I witnessed.  - Patient had been saying: Mama, Dada, Nose, Hair, had been practicing feeding himself, and when asked would point to a body part.  - 09/14/2019 he said ?sit down? his first 2 word sentence ever, (I was so proud, I documented it!) After his shot, he did not say the above words again until just a few months ago after months of speech therapy.  When I asked if he wanted to hold a utensil to help feed himself, he would act as if he were throwing a tantrum.  When his toys (that he has played with for months) would make a noise, he would flinch, when prior to the shot, he never did this.  He did not point to his body parts again for months as well, until speech therapy and months of me working with him again.   A few treatments that have helped are, of course, speech therapy (he began this in maybe February) and glutathione cream.  His doctor now has been amazing and very supportive and has said that he?s improved so much.</td>\n",

Everything was going good then the night of December 9th I was helping her wipe after potty time and I noticed some little specks. Didnt think much of it since there was none any where else at the time. They got a little bigger and a little more red but i figured shes a kid and was scooting around on the ground so I didnt think much of it put some lotion on. December 13th come and she woke up and had those little spots down on her ankles and im like geeze maybe we have bugs in the house. So I checked everybody and couldnt find anybody else who has any little bumps. We went to my moms which is about 45 mins away spent the day with her and she just keeps getting more spots but only on her legs. Then im like well maybe she has the chicken pox! My mom looks at them and they just started growing right before our eyes!   So I go to head home and in that 45 min window they grew about 4X the original size and are now completely covering her legs and butt. I call my nurse friend and shes like maybe its Hives give her some benadryl and see what they look like in the morning so i do that. In the morning they were a dark deep redish purple almost like a bruise so i called the clinic to get her in. They ask a bunch of questions and have her pee in a hat and come back tell me that its something called HSP.   Dr didn't really explain much on what causes it he just said that it can be caused by a few things. So i check the CDC for it and one of the things listed for a cause is the chicken pox. She hasn't been sick hasn't been around anybody who has been sick we have not changed her diet etc so i fell like its an adverse reaction to the shot.   Once he explained to me some of the symptoms I feel like she was showing sooner then December 9th because shes been complaining about her legs and her hands hurting since the first week of December and he said joint pain is a side effect of HSP.   He prescribed a steroid to help keep it out of the kidney and told us to keep an eye out for bloody urine and bloody stool.   We are currently home and she still has her big purple rash on the bottom half of her body.</td>\n",

The foetus' mother's concurrent condition included body mass index increased. The foetus' mother's past medical history included urinary tract Infection with group B Streptococcus. The foetus' mother's concomitant medication included Prenatal DHA vitamin (unspecified vitamins and docosahexaenoic acid) for pregnancy, Flintstones (unspecified vitamins) for pregnancy and amoxicillin for urinary tract infection with group B Streptococcus.  The mother's obstetrical history included five previous pregnancies with two full term live births, two spontaneous abortions and one preterm live birth. The foetus' mother had no history of offspring with major congenital malformation (MCM). The foetus' mother had no maternal or paternal history with MCM. The foetus' mother did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.   The mother's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 25-Jun-2020, estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 01-Apr-2021 and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was reported as 02-Apr-2021. The type of pregnancy was singleton. The foetus' father was 33-year-old.    On 11-Sep-2020, at gestational age of 11 weeks (calculated per LMP), the foetus' mother was vaccinated with Afluria QIV (Flu Vaccine Egg Split QIV CSL) (influenza vaccine; dose, route of administration and  anatomical location: not reported) (explicitly coded as 'Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation. The batch number reported was P100230203.   On the same day, after receiving Afluria QIV, it was determined that the mother was group B Streptococcus carrier. Also, ultrasound, Counsyl fundamental panel with fragile X and Counsyl chromosomes 13, 18, 21 and sex chromosome analysis revealed no MCMs.  On 28-Sep-2020, 17 days after receiving Afluria QIV, the foetus' mother developed human papilloma virus (HPV) infection with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I (CIN 1).  02-Nov-2020, ultrasound revealed MCM anterior abdominal wall defect in foetus.  The outcome of the event 'abdominal wall anomaly' was not reported.  The reporter did not provide a causality assessment to Afluria QIV.  The event 'abdominal wall anomaly' was considered serious due to criterion of congenital anomaly and medical significance by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  This case is linked to a case 202005412 (the corresponding mother case).  Company comment: A 33-year-old, pregnant subject experienced abdominal wall anomaly almost 2 months after administration of Afluria QIV. Causality is assessed as not related to vaccine due to biological implausibility and more likely related to the mother's medical history of BMI increased. More information regarding adnominal wall anomaly is needed for a more precise causality assessment. Foetal exposure during pregnancy is assessed as unrelated per company conventions.; Sender's Comments: A 33-year-old, pregnant subject experienced abdominal wall anomaly almost 2 months after administration of Afluria QIV.

Came to office today (48h after injections) due to spreading redness and warmth and tense/tight feeling at site. No fevers or constitutional symptoms and no pain complaint. Area of redness/warmth 11cm x 14cm. No edema. 2-3 very small pinpoint intact blisters centrally. No edema. I did treat as a cellulitis (with possible minimal extravasation with the blisters centrally) in addition to supportive measures. I asked to return for f/u in 48h if persistent or sooner if acute worsening or new symptoms.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Got the PNEUMOVAX 23 shot on 11/18/2020 - I began having reaction 11/21.  I had high fevers up to 103.8 for over a week. Since symptoms were similar, I got a COVID test on 11/21 which was negative. 11/24 I developed hives over my whole body, mouth, lips, torso, thighs, arms, which lasted 3 weeks. The doctor prescribed Hydroxyzine which didn't help much. On 11/25 - the Dr. prescribed Prednisone 20mg to help with the hives and calm it down. On 11/28 developed wheezing, shortness of breath and on 11/30 - was analyzed for heart and lungs issues by paramedics. On 12/8 - GP - Dr. diagnosed me with possible reactive airway dysfunction and prescribed an inhaler.   I've found that then inhaler alone does not do the trick.  Since the word reactive is in the diagnosis, I figured I'd try an antihistamine.  I tried Benadryl but it is not as long lasting.  On Sunday, I tried taking  a Benadryl over night and then didn't take a Zyrtec first thing to see how it went. I did not go out to the barn or do any big activities.  I ended up having breathing problems.     I'm 67 and have never had a reaction like this in my life. I am still having breathing problems as of today 12/16. I had a pneumonia shot 10 years ago and had no reaction. I had the flu shot -by Sanofi Pasteur on October 28th  and had the expected  mild reaction - sore arm, felt a little crummy part of one day.  No big deal.  I went about my activities.  Previous to this, I have never used an inhaler in my life. I'm not a smoker. I've started taking Zyrtec 1x per day in the morning  to help with the reactive lung issues. This seems to work the best at this time.  If I don't take it, I start having breathing issues.    I am allergic to penicillin, sulfa drugs, and cephalosporins.   I am a professional photographer, do quite a bit of walking for my profession.   I also have horses, ride 2-3 times per week &amp; do daily chores with the horses. I also care for my grandson part time.  I'm an active person. This has left me with much lower energy and breathing problems which I've never experienced in my life!  I don't know if this is permanent, but I sure hope not!  It has prevented me from caring for my grandson at times, has curtailed my riding and horse care activities, and has curtailed my ability to hike and walk for my photographic business.  I'm concerned about my reaction to the pneumonia vaccine and the ability to take a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available.</td>\n",

Per Mother's request he received 2 of the 4 month schedule vaccines. I had another nurse check vaccines to be given. We read Rotateq as Dec 20 20. Vaccines administered. When I went to enter Rotateq in the patient's chart I could not find the LOT number. I checked Roteq again and noted the date printed was 5 Dec 2020. I immediately let the patient's PCP know. I also went to my Supervisor and called the patient's Mother to inform her of the incident and that son would need to repeat Rotateq. I removed the vaccine from the refrigerator and wrote expired on it and gave it to my supervisor. I also filled out an unusual occurrence form. No harm came to the child but he will have to repeat  Rotateq.  \n",

He received a DTaP shot at about 11:30am, we got home maybe 20-30 minutes later where I stood him in our living room and got settled. At about 12:00pm he started crying inconsolably, but wouldn?t move.  I said, ?come here,? but he just stood there, cries turning to screams. I grab his hand to get him to walk closer, but he falls over and does not get up.  I pick him up, trying to calm him, but he?s still crying uncontrollably.  I try to stand him in my lap, but he feels limp. I check everything on him, making sure he?s okay, seeing what I can do to help, nothing helps.  I have no clue what?s going on or how to help, so I call the doctors office - I can only hear some of what they are saying, but I try to tell the nurse what?s going on while he cries in the background, the nurse told me that soreness is to be expected and to give some Tylenol.  We?ve had shots before, but never any of this. Never crying like this, never going limp like this.  I finally calm him down and get him to sleep long enough for my husband to come home.  After weeks/months of research, talking to a family friend who had knowledge in this area, and a few nurse friends, I was able to discover that this was a hypotonic hypersensitive episode.   That afternoon and the following few days of that week, it?s as if Patient was re-learning how to walk. He was 15 months and had started walking at 11 months, so this was not a difficult task for him, but he was very clumsy, would stumble and fall several times a day. My husband and I both made comments to each other about him being very clumsy.  Patient also had/has a speech regression/delay which I am confident came after this. I only say this because I spent every day with him before and after and watched the regression and these are the things that I witnessed.  - Patient had been saying: Mama, Dada, Nose, Hair, had been practicing feeding himself, and when asked would point to a body part.  - 09/14/2019 he said ?sit down? his first 2 word sentence ever, (I was so proud, I documented it!) After his shot, he did not say the above words again until just a few months ago after months of speech therapy.  When I asked if he wanted to hold a utensil to help feed himself, he would act as if he were throwing a tantrum.  When his toys (that he has played with for months) would make a noise, he would flinch, when prior to the shot, he never did this.  He did not point to his body parts again for months as well, until speech therapy and months of me working with him again.   A few treatments that have helped are, of course, speech therapy (he began this in maybe February) and glutathione cream.  His doctor now has been amazing and very supportive and has said that he?s improved so much.  \n",

Had sores in mouth, low grade fever all day, aches and pain all over with nausea and diarrhea. Lasted for about a whole week. I went to dentist for sores in mouth (was prescribed mouthwash). The diarrhea finally subsided. When I saw a doctor, he gave me mouth was for the sores in mouth as well.  The initial  feeling of me not feeling well lasted for a week, but the sores and diarrhea lasted a lot longer.  \n",

By Friday, I had smooth redness the size of an egg and felt like someone slugged me which also seemed fairly normal side effect.  Next day a little itching and tenderness and Sunday almost all the redness was gone except a few red blotches a little further away from the injection site.  Felt fine except a little light-headedness.  This morning the redness had grown to a about 6\" diameter.  Still smooth.  Only a little tingling feeling. Headache, but not intense, and still a little light headedness but not dizzy.  Took 2 Benadryl 25mg  and called pharmacist who recommended I also ice it, and if become worse tomorrow to go to Urgent Care.  \n",

The day after, I had a large red circle on my arm that was hot and swollen for 2 weeks. Then, the swelling decreased and it became a large purple bruise that I still have 6 weeks later.  \n",

Decided to take a day off of work and continue to rest, drink plenty of liquids and Tylenol.  It is now almost 2pm and suspect I will return to normal capacity by tomorrow morning.  \n",

Everything was going good then the night of December 9th I was helping her wipe after potty time and I noticed some little specks. Didnt think much of it since there was none any where else at the time. They got a little bigger and a little more red but i figured shes a kid and was scooting around on the ground so I didnt think much of it put some lotion on. December 13th come and she woke up and had those little spots down on her ankles and im like geeze maybe we have bugs in the house. So I checked everybody and couldnt find anybody else who has any little bumps. We went to my moms which is about 45 mins away spent the day with her and she just keeps getting more spots but only on her legs. Then im like well maybe she has the chicken pox! My mom looks at them and they just started growing right before our eyes!   So I go to head home and in that 45 min window they grew about 4X the original size and are now completely covering her legs and butt. I call my nurse friend and shes like maybe its Hives give her some benadryl and see what they look like in the morning so i do that. In the morning they were a dark deep redish purple almost like a bruise so i called the clinic to get her in. They ask a bunch of questions and have her pee in a hat and come back tell me that its something called HSP.   Dr didn't really explain much on what causes it he just said that it can be caused by a few things. So i check the CDC for it and one of the things listed for a cause is the chicken pox. She hasn't been sick hasn't been around anybody who has been sick we have not changed her diet etc so i fell like its an adverse reaction to the shot.   Once he explained to me some of the symptoms I feel like she was showing sooner then December 9th because shes been complaining about her legs and her hands hurting since the first week of December and he said joint pain is a side effect of HSP.   He prescribed a steroid to help keep it out of the kidney and told us to keep an eye out for bloody urine and bloody stool.   We are currently home and she still has her big purple rash on the bottom half of her body.  \n",

The next day it was getting worse and it's now over two months and the throbbing and achy feeling in my arm and shoulder is still there.  There is also a burning feeling  \n",

I gave 2 of the first 4 Covid vaccinations given at our location.  Then I received dose # 5.  It was easy.  I did a couple of things and then returned to my desk.  As I sat down, my arm started feeling very heavy.  I was unable to send a text.  I told staff that I was feeling funny and that I was going to the other room to lay down.  Staff followed me and took my Pulse 100 and BP 164/ 82 (high for me!)  .  I felt shaky, but my hands were not shaking.  Put a wet cloth on my head and laid there a few minutes, telling staff stories and laughing at my BP.  When I sat up, my BP was 126/74 and pulse was 80.  I stood up for a minute or two, then my legs got heavy and I sat down for a few more minutes.  I went to the bathroom and came back to my desk, but was weak and tired.  I ate and drank some fluids.  Because it was snowing  and I live 25 miles away, I accepted a ride home from a co-worker.  I walked across the parking lot without problems and talked all the way home.  At home, I was tired, but had a sandwich and talked on the phone.  I would still describe myself as tired, but functioning.  \n",

She was sitting, and felt short of breath without wheeze or tightness in the chest or throat.  She stood up, and then felt tunneling.  Assisted to chair and floor.  Pulse weak, skin flushed, sweating on torso.  Face and Neck remained flushed and red. She refused epi at first.  So we gave her benedryll 25 mg po with apple juice.  She said she just had a big meal 30 min prior, but we checked her blood sugar- it was 85.  10 min after the first SOB feeling, it returned.  BP was recorded as 160/100.  \n",

Went to hospital; RN told me he thought the needle had hit a blood vessel and should go away in a few days.   A week later I started getting red bumps around site, back and neck.  Itching and soreness.  Talked to my doctor who said some side effects take longer to heal.  It is now 3 weeks and no better and rash has spread  a little.  \n",

Woke up at 11:30PM with a fever was cold and shivering, Woke up again at 1:30AM and my mouth was completely dry and my right hand was cramped and could not move. These all my Sjogren's symptoms but more severe than I had ever felt them before. At 4:30AM my fever was 99.3 and I still had all the aforementioned symptoms. I was extremely tired and felt nauseous. By 8AM I had stomach cramping followed by diarrhea. My stomach was too upset to eat at all the entire day of the 14th. I had off and on stomach pains with diarrhea. I was very tired and could not stay awake for very long. My temperature went back down to my normal 97.2 by 10 AM. My right hand is still very hard to move and painful today on the 16TH. My stomach still feels queasy. I have not had a fever again, but still feel horrible. I have not gone to my primary doctor because there is nothing he can do to help.  \n",

       "176  Anterior abdominal wall defect; Foetal exposure during pregnancy; This is an observational study case, received from other health professional on 07-Dec-2020 and concerned a foetus, whose mother was 33-year-old, pregnant subject of body weight: 178 lbs, height: 67 inches and body mass index (BMI): 27.9, enrolled, a prospective observational safety study on pregnancy outcomes in women immunized with Afluria QIV, a seasonal quadrivalent vaccine, during pregnancy.   The foetus' mother's concurrent condition included body mass index increased. The foetus' mother's past medical history included urinary tract Infection with group B Streptococcus. The foetus' mother's concomitant medication included Prenatal DHA vitamin (unspecified vitamins and docosahexaenoic acid) for pregnancy, Flintstones (unspecified vitamins) for pregnancy and amoxicillin for urinary tract infection with group B Streptococcus.  The mother's obstetrical history included five previous pregnancies with two full term live births, two spontaneous abortions and one preterm live birth. The foetus' mother had no history of offspring with major congenital malformation (MCM). The foetus' mother had no maternal or paternal history with MCM. The foetus' mother did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.   The mother's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 25-Jun-2020, estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 01-Apr-2021 and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was reported as 02-Apr-2021. The type of pregnancy was singleton. The foetus' father was 33-year-old.    On 11-Sep-2020, at gestational age of 11 weeks (calculated per LMP), the foetus' mother was vaccinated with Afluria QIV (Flu Vaccine Egg Split QIV CSL) (influenza vaccine; dose, route of administration and  anatomical location: not reported) (explicitly coded as 'Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation. The batch number reported was P100230203.   On the same day, after receiving Afluria QIV, it was determined that the mother was group B Streptococcus carrier. Also, ultrasound, Counsyl fundamental panel with fragile X and Counsyl chromosomes 13, 18, 21 and sex chromosome analysis revealed no MCMs.  On 28-Sep-2020, 17 days after receiving Afluria QIV, the foetus' mother developed human papilloma virus (HPV) infection with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I (CIN 1).  02-Nov-2020, ultrasound revealed MCM anterior abdominal wall defect in foetus.  The outcome of the event 'abdominal wall anomaly' was not reported.  The reporter did not provide a causality assessment to Afluria QIV.  The event 'abdominal wall anomaly' was considered serious due to criterion of congenital anomaly and medical significance by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  This case is linked to a case 202005412 (the corresponding mother case).  Company comment: A 33-year-old, pregnant subject experienced abdominal wall anomaly almost 2 months after administration of Afluria QIV. Causality is assessed as not related to vaccine due to biological implausibility and more likely related to the mother's medical history of BMI increased. More information regarding adnominal wall anomaly is needed for a more precise causality assessment. Foetal exposure during pregnancy is assessed as unrelated per company conventions.; Sender's Comments: A 33-year-old, pregnant subject experienced abdominal wall anomaly almost 2 months after administration of Afluria QIV. Causality is assessed as not related to vaccine due to biological implausibility and more likely related to the mother's medical history of BMI increased.

These symptoms continued through four days after the day of injection. Most symptoms are gone now, but my arm is still swollen, tender, warm to the touch and bruised. It sometimes aches enough that I need to take ibuprofen.  \n",

Marked with pen by family. Came to office today (48h after injections) due to spreading redness and warmth and tense/tight feeling at site. No fevers or constitutional symptoms and no pain complaint. Area of redness/warmth 11cm x 14cm. No edema. 2-3 very small pinpoint intact blisters centrally. No edema.

Marked with pen by family. Came to office today (48h after injections) due to spreading redness and warmth and tense/tight feeling at site. No fevers or constitutional symptoms and no pain complaint. Area of redness/warmth 11cm x 14cm. No edema. 2-3 very small pinpoint intact blisters centrally. No edema. I did treat as a cellulitis (with possible minimal extravasation with the blisters centrally) in addition to supportive measures. I asked to return for f/u in 48h if persistent or sooner if acute worsening or new symptoms.  \n",

I had high fevers up to 103.8 for over a week. Since symptoms were similar, I got a COVID test on 11/21 which was negative. 11/24 I developed hives over my whole body, mouth, lips, torso, thighs, arms, which lasted 3 weeks. The doctor prescribed Hydroxyzine which didn't help much. On 11/25 - the Dr. prescribed Prednisone 20mg to help with the hives and calm it down. On 11/28 developed wheezing, shortness of breath and on 11/30 - was analyzed for heart and lungs issues by paramedics. On 12/8 - GP - Dr. diagnosed me with possible reactive airway dysfunction and prescribed an inhaler.   I've found that then inhaler alone does not do the trick.  Since the word reactive is in the diagnosis, I figured I'd try an antihistamine.  I tried Benadryl but it is not as long lasting.  On Sunday, I tried taking  a Benadryl over night and then didn't take a Zyrtec first thing to see how it went. I did not go out to the barn or do any big activities.  I ended up having breathing problems.     I'm 67 and have never had a reaction like this in my life. I am still having breathing problems as of today 12/16. I had a pneumonia shot 10 years ago and had no reaction. I had the flu shot -by Sanofi Pasteur on October 28th  and had the expected  mild reaction - sore arm, felt a little crummy part of one day.  No big deal.  I went about my activities.  Previous to this, I have never used an inhaler in my life. I'm not a smoker. I've started taking Zyrtec 1x per day in the morning  to help with the reactive lung issues. This seems to work the best at this time.  If I don't take it, I start having breathing issues.    I am allergic to penicillin, sulfa drugs, and cephalosporins.   I am a professional photographer, do quite a bit of walking for my profession.   I also have horses, ride 2-3 times per week & do daily chores with the horses. I also care for my grandson part time.  I'm an active person. This has left me with much lower energy and breathing problems which I've never experienced in my life!  I don't know if this is permanent, but I sure hope not!  It has prevented me from caring for my grandson at times, has curtailed my riding and horse care activities, and has curtailed my ability to hike and walk for my photographic business.  I'm concerned about my reaction to the pneumonia vaccine and the ability to take a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available.  \n",

On Sunday 12/13/20, she  woke up to a raised rash all over my body.  She took Benadryl to relieve the itching but had to go to the doctors on Monday for tightness in throat but did not have difficulty breathing.  The prescriber put her on a 5 day Prednisone and continue with a 24 hr. allergy medicine and Benadryl as needed.  On Tue 12/15/20 she still had the rash.  The rash is fading but still itchy underneath her skin.  \n",

The agent helped walk me to a chair and I felt really loopy in the head.  After the 15 minutes, I got up and immediately felt the whole room was spinning causing me to have to sit back down another 15 minutes.  Closing my eyes made the dizziness much worse.  I was given juice, my sugar was checked at was 115.  After about 30 minutes I stood and felt alot better.  I went back to my assigned duties but was feeling super bad and my supervisor sent me home because they states I didnt look good.  On the drive home I threw up and my PCP called in Zopran to help with the nausea.  \n",

She stated she fell and couldn't get back up because the injection site was so sore and painful.  She did not experience this with her first dose at all.  She stated she's taken tylenol and it has helped somewhat.  She was about to try using a warm compress on the site when I spoke to her about an hour ago.  I told her I would report the incident and then reach back out to her to follow up.  She stated she has an appointment on Monday with her doctor, so she plans to mention it then.  I also called the doctor's office to notify them of the occurrence.  \n",

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient was vaccinated with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent (brand not specified; dose, route of administration, anatomical location and indication: not reported). The batch number was not reported.  On an unspecified date, an unknown amount of time after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, the patient developed delayed hypersensitive reaction of itchy hives all over her body.  The outcome of events was not reported.  The reporter assessed events as related to influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. The patient had the exact same reaction to the 2016 flu vaccine.  The case is linked to 202005290 (the same patient).  Case updated on 27-Nov-2020: Correction made to information received on 19-Oct-2020: Suspect product recoded from INN Seasonal to INN Flu Vaccine Seasonal. Narrative and company comment amended accordingly.  Company comment: Type IV hypersensitivity reaction, urticaria and pruritus were associated with the use of the suspect product influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. The events occurred on an unknown time after vaccination. Chronology is unclarified. The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. With information presented, causality is assessed as unlikely related due to unclarified temporality, biological plausibility and lack of other confounding factors. (unlikely related defaults to related for reporting purposes); Reporter's Comments: The reporter stated: I had the exact same reaction to the 2016 flu vaccine.; Sender's Comments: Type IV hypersensitivity reaction, urticaria and pruritus were associated with the use of the suspect product influenza virus vaccine polyvalent.

I felt really tired and came home and slept until 3 pm.  When I woke up I had a dull headache and felt crummy.  Decided to sleep the remainder of the day but no fever just was fatigued and had a headache.  My arm was hurting at the injection site but the pain has sense left and the headache is gone also.  \n",

The vaccine was administered on 11/17/2020 and it expired on 10/23/2020.
